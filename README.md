# sunshine - Udacity Android Fundamentals Course Repository

This repository will be used to store my progress on the udacity course, and
its prepration for the study group here in berlin.

It is not allways perfect, and it sometimes diverges slightly from the course
purposal. Mostly because I want to try out different things and compare it with 
the puposed way.

Enjoy!
